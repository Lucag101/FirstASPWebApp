    There's a couple things I want to get out of IS 413. First off, I want to improve my abilities in C#.
    Many of the potential employers I've talked to, seem to want their interns/employees to know it.
    Besides that, I want to learn to learn how to use a program like ASP to more efficiently code in various different languages.
